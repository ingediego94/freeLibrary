# FREE LIBRARY

## About:
This project was made with a clear perspective of bring an space to Riwi students for searching books for their learning process. In this first phase was created a page to seaching books of many topics, in the second phase our goal will be create a system to count books in our library for managing the borrow process, all of this based in a CRUD system in JS.

## Searching process:
Finding a book in our platform it's a simple process, you only need to write your desired book in the searching bar and press "search", with this you'll see all books related with the book's titles.


### Second phase:
We are going to planning create a system based in a CRUD process to manage each book's borrow.
